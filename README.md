# Date Range

A package for handling date ranges.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require 20tries/date_range
```

Or in your composer.json file

`
"require": {
    "20tries/date_range": "dev-master"
  },
`

It is recommended to use `dev-master` (currently default) as this is the most stable; other branches are currently in development and will be subject to API change.
